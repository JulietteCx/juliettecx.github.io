  <h1> Hello, and welcome to my website!</h1>
<body>
I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Oxford. I'm also currently doing an internship at the Bank of England. 
I work on spatial economics, focusing on the effects of physical risk on economic outcomes. I also like to think about the feasibility of climate policies, from a theoretical perspective. 
  

I studied at the Ecole nationale des ponts et chaussées, an engineering school in France. I then moved to London, where I graduated from the Master of Public Administration at the London School of Economics. 

Before joining Oxford, I worked in the private sector at Crédit Agricole CIB, where I applied securitisation techniques to fund off-grid solar projects in Africa. I then joined the French Embassy in Germany. During my master's, I worked at the ECB and the Bank of England. 

In the Summer 2024, I crossed the Atlantic and joined the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC for the Fund Internship Program. 

I am very fortunate to have been the recipient of the Margaret Thatcher scholarship, at Somerville College.

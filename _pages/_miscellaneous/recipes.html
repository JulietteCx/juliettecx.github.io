<p>When I'm not working at the Bank of England or on my PhD, I love to cook — especially French pastries! — and to create my own recipes. I want to use this page to share some of this and some tips I learned along the way.</p>

            <!-- Chocolate Cake Recipe -->
            <h2>The ultimate chocolate cake </h2>
            <p>I love chocolate cakes. I try to make one for each birthday. For a really long time (and I probably mean for the last ten years) I have been failing at making them as I wanted, i.e., not too sweet, crispy at the top and slightly melting at the bottom. After years of experimenting, here's the ultimate recipe:</p>
            <button class="toggle-btn" onclick="toggleContent('recipe-chocolate')">Toggle Recipe</button>
    
            <div id="recipe-chocolate" class="hidden">
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>200g chocolate (I take it with 70% cocoa)</li>
                    <li>100g butter</li>
                    <li>60g flour</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>10g of sugar (literally)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <div class="steps">
                    <p>Preheat the oven in fan mode at 180&deg;C.</p>
                    <p>Grease a plate (I have a 20cm-squared glass one).</p>
                    <p>Break the chocolate in tiny pieces.</p>
                    <p>Dice the butter in small cubes.</p>
                    <p>In a double boiler, melt the chocolate.</p>
                    <p>When the chocolate is melted, add small pieces of butter, one after another.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, whip up the eggs (combined, yolk and white together) until the preparation triples in volume.</p>
                    <p>When all the butter is incorporated, add the flour to the chocolate preparation (<em>this is key!</em>).</p>
                    <p>Combine the two preparations by adding the chocolate mixture to the eggs. Mix very delicately until the preparation is homogenous. Avoid overmixing to prevent the eggs from collapsing.</p>
                    <p>Pour the preparation into the greased plate.</p>
                    <p>Bake for 20 minutes, or until you can slide a knife in and it comes out clean.</p>

         <h2>Parfait à la rhubarbe et coulis à la framboise (<i>Rhubarb Parfait with Raspberry Coulis</i>) </h2>
        <p> I created this recipe after a bit of trial and error. I am particularly proud of it because it's possible to make it in batch and freeze it. It's a bit advanced, but if you follow the steps carefully, it will be worth it! Aside from the usual cooking utensils, you will need a cooking thermometer.</p>

                <div id="recette-parfait" class="hidden">
                    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>500g rhubarb</li>
                        <li>100g raspberries</li>
                        <li> 20cL cream (liquid) </li>
                        <li>3 eggs</li>
                        <li>50g water</li>
                        <li>100g sugar</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <div class="steps">
                        <ol>
                        <p>In two separate pots, melt the raspberry and the rhubarb, at low temperature. Stir occasionally. When the preparation is smooth, let it cool at room temperature. </p>
                        <p>In the meantime, in a cold bowl, whip up the cream in a chantilly. You can add a bit of sugar & vanilla. Once done, let it cool at room temperature.</p>
                        <b> Sabayon </b>
                        <p> With the eggs, the sugar and the water, prepare a sabayon: </p>
                        <p> Put the water and the sugar in a small pan and heat until 118°C (this is why we need a thermometer!).</p>
                        <p>In the meantime, whisk the eggs in a beater until the preparation doubles in volume and becomes whiter.</p>
                        <p> Once the sugar + water has reached 118°C add slowly to the eggs while still beating. The idea is that the heated sugar will "cook" the preparation. </p>
                            <p> Continue whipping the preparation until it cools down (you can touch the bowl to get an idea). </p>
                            <p> When all the (i) rhubarb (ii) whipped cream and (iii) sabayon preparations are roughly the same temperature, combine together and mix delicately so that the sabayon does not fall down </p>
                        <b> Staging: </b>
                            <p> Put the preparation in a piping bag with your favourite 1cm nozzle. </p>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
        
                    <p>You're done!</p>
